## About the Project üìù

> This project provides a backend API for a mobile app that delivers student lesson schedules. It automatically scrapes the official school website using Requests and BeautifulSoup4 to gather up-to-date schedule information. The data scraping process is automated and scheduled with APScheduler to run at regular intervals. Extracted schedules are stored securely in Firebase Firestore, enabling real-time syncing with the mobile app. The backend API is built with FastAPI, ensuring high performance and easy scalability. Configuration management is handled using python-dotenv for secure and flexible environment variables. The codebase is tested using pytest to maintain reliability. Overall, the system ensures students have timely access to accurate lesson schedules through an automated and efficient backend.
